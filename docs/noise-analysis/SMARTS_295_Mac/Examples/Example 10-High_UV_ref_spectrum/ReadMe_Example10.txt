	READ ME -- Example 10:SMARTS 2.9.5 Version of a reference UV spectrumThis example produces results for the same atmospheric conditions as the ASTM G177-03 reference spectrum. However:  (i)  some absorption and scattering functions have been improved in the model;  (ii) the NEW Gueymard Extraterrestrial Spectrum is used. Thus this input file does NOT reproduce ASTM G177-03 EXACTLY. SMARTS 2.9.2 MUST be used to produce a true wavelength-by-wavelength replica of the ASTM G177-03 reference standard spectrum!
