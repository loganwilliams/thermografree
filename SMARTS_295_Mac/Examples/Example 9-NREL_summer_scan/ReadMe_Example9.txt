	READ ME -- Example 9-NREL_summer_scanThis example illustrates how to predict the output of a spectroradiometer under realistic conditions. The experiment actually took place at NREL, Golden, Colorado during the Summer of 2001.A tracking spectroradiometer measured direct beam radiation within a 3-deg. half acceptance angle. The instrument's FWHM is 6.15 nm, its spectral response with wavelength is close to Gaussian, its useful spectral range is 300-1100 nm, and it outputs results at 2-nm intervals from 300 nm.The basic atmospheric profiles for this summertime experiment are assumed to be described by the default MLS reference atmosphere.The site being relatively close to various pollution sources within the Denver urban area, the LIGHT POLLUTION option is selected. The type of aerosol is not known, but is probably close to a rural model.A "Dry grass" reflectance model is assumed to represent the area's albedo conditions.
