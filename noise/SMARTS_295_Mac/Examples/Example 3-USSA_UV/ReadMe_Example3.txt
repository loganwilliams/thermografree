	READ ME -- Example 3-UV_reference_spectraThis example shows how to generate a reference UV spectrum that matches the atmospheric conditions also used in older terrestrial solar irradiance standards (ASTM E891-87, ASTM E892-87, ASTM G159-99; ISO 9845-1). See Example 6 to approximate the more recent ASTM G173 spectra, and Example 10 to approximate the UV spectrum defined by ASTM G177.SMARTS2 will be run here from 280 to 400 nm, and the optional broadband-UV calculations will be added for demonstration purposes.As also explained in Example 1, these standards specify an air mass of 1.5, a rural aerosol with  optical thickness of 0.27 at 500 nm, a US Standard Atmosphere with 1.42 cm precipitable water and 0.34 atm-cm ozone, a fixed broadband albedo of 0.2, and circumsolar radiation within a cone of about 2.9 deg. half angle. These conditions are used here in the first run. A second run is added with identical conditions, except for an air mass of 1.2.The differences with Example 1 are the wavelength limits (see above), the output wavelength interval (0.5 nm in the present case), the request for 2 successive runs here (instead of 1 in Example 1), and the request for UV specific calculations here (instead of the illuminance specific calculations in Example 1).
