	READ ME -- Example 1: USSA reference spectrumThis example shows how to generate a higher resolution version of the old terrestrial solar irradiance standards (ASTM E891-87, ASTM E892-87, ASTM G159-99; ISO 9845-1), now superseded by ASTM G173-03 (see Example 6). SMARTS will be run here from 300 to 4000 nm at 1 to 5 nm intervals, whereas these older standards are from 305 to 4045 nm at variable intervals. They have been generated by BRITE, a Monte-Carlo rigorous code that is not available anymore, so that SMARTS can be used as an alternative to reconstruct these reference spectra at finer resolution or simulate the effect of different atmospheric conditions.These older standards specify an air mass of 1.5, a rural aerosol with optical thickness of 0.27 at 500 nm, a US Standard Atmosphere with 1.42 cm precipitable water and 0.34 atm-cm ozone, a fixed broadband albedo of 0.2, and circumsolar radiation within a cone of about 2.9 deg. half angle. The standards are for direct normal irradiance and for global irradiance received on a surface tilted 37 deg. toward the sun.The Shettle & Fenn's rural aerosol model has been selected here because it is the closest approximation to the specific rural aerosol used in BRITE, which was a preliminary--but different--version of the Shettle & Fenn aerosol model used in SMARTS and MODTRAN. Almost identical results are obtained when using SRA's continental aerosol.The illuminances corresponding to these irradiances are also calculated for demonstration purposes.
