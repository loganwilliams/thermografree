	READ ME -- Example 7-Phoenix_summer_UVIn this Example, illuminance, luminous efficacy, and extra UV calculations are demonstrated. Solar noon time for two specific mid-summer days is considered: July 15, 2000 and August 15, 2000. To approach the exact solar noon (i.e., Local Apparent Time, or LAT, exactly equal to 12), a preliminary run was necessary because the input time is Local Standard Time which differs slightly from LAT. (See the User's Manual, Card 17a.)The selected site is Phoenix, Arizona (latitude 33.433N, longitude 112.007W).The spectral UV irradiance is calculated and printed on File 17 for a vertical surface facing South.The illuminance and luminous efficacy are calculated too.All gaseous abundances are defaulted from the reference atmosphere selected (MLS), but the PRISTINE atmosphere option will modify some of them. A "Light sandy soil" is selected for both reflectance calculations.
