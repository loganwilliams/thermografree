	READ ME -- Example 11:Irradiance on vertical surfaces.Thiese calculations refer to Chapter 5 ('Solar Spectral Radiation', by C.A. Gueymard and H.D. Kambezidis) of this textbook:   T. Muneer, Solar radiation and daylight models, 2nd ed., Elsevier, 2004.This example produces spectra on vertical surfaces, simulating an ideal building located at an altitude of 500 m and surrounded by lawn (green grass).This particular example is for a south orientation and three air mass values.Illuminances are also calculated for daylighting applications.
